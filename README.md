## APNI MANDI - An E-Commerce Portal providing direct link between Farmers and Buyers
<p>

> <em> Agriculture is known as primary sector of country and contributes only 17% GDP of country by providing 53% employment.
Farmers are directly linked to agriculture sector but many of them are committing suicide or have big loans to pay. 
Main root causes are low selling price, corruption of aarthis, spoilage of production etc. With this website, we ought to solve this problem by removing the aarthi 
from this process so that both buyers and sellers can benefit from the same. In these times of pandemic too, the farmers are suffering a lot, as people are skeptical
about going to market to buy veggies and consider online buying a favourable option. </em>
